Basics of c++

To output the data in c++

cout << value1 << value2 << value3 << endl;

endl is used for new line


Bool Data type 

bool a = true

cout << a << endl;

it prints 1 as output instead of true. so here true will be printed as 1 and 

false will be printed as 0.


Input in C++

cin >> value1 >> value2 >> value3 >> endl;


For loops 


for(s1;s2;s3){}


while loops

while(condition){}


Arrays 

int arr[5] = {1, 2, 34, 5, 6};

to print values of array 

for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
    cout << arr[i] << endl;
}

or we can use this

for(auto val : arr){
    cout << val << endll;
}

here val represents the element of the array not the index.


if the array is double then we should use &

for(auto &val : arr){
    cout << val << endl;
}


Range of data types 

1) Int :- -2^32 to 2^32 - 1

it will be appromately equal to 10^9 and
long int will be same as int

2 ) long long int : -2^64 to 2^64 - 1

it will be appromately equal to 10^18

so whenever the consraints will be 10^9 then use int and 
            the constraints will be 10^18 then use long long int

3) Float will be 7 digits
   Double will be 15 digits
   long double will be 18 digits


NameSpace :- It contains various variables and functions

using namespace std; will be used frequently

if we dont use above statement then we have to use like this 

std :: cin >> val >> endl;

at every statement


Header Files :- It contains various functions and etc

#include <iostream> will be used for inputs and outputs

but if we declare like this then we have to define many statements for various uses 

like one for strings one for maps and etc.


#include <bits/stdc++.h> will be used in the competitive programming.

this statement includes all libraries we require in the program and 

we dont need to include any other statements.

use this in cp to save the time

but don't use this in development.


ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)/b


Time Complexity

1second ~ 10^7 to 10^9 operations depends on quality of the code

Elementary Operations takes constant time

int a,b,c,d;

res = (a+b+c+d)/4; is an Elementary Operation

string s, t;

if(s<t){
    cout << s << endl;
}

it is not an Elementary Operation

cin >> s is not an Elementary Operation . it takes O(N) time

string operations are not Elementary


in general , O(100000n^2) will be treated as O(n^2)

but if time limit per test is like say 1 second or say a 
finite amount of time then O(100000N^2) will be treated differently than O(n^2)


String s = "abc";

s[1] = "a"; this is not allowed

s[1] = 'a'; this is allowed 

'a' is literal "a" is string

reverse(s.begin(),s.end()) reverses the string

s.begin takes the index 0 and s.end taked the index n and n is exclusive

cout << (s == t ? "YES" : "NO") << endl; ternery operator

transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);

it converts each and every letter of the string to lower case
